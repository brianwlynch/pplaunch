# TFC Public Panel Launcher

**PPLaunch** is a small client-side "app" meant for use on TFC public panels such as touchscreens and tablets. It enables these devices to power up before the TFC servers without the need for a human to refresh the browser once the TFC servers are online.

**DISCLAIMER** - This is not an official TFC Product. If something does not work **DO NOT** contact TFC Support, they will not be able to help you!
