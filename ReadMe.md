# TFC Soft Panel Launcher
*This is not an official TFC Product*

This is a program to automatically load the TFC panel on a touch screen.

On first install you will be in debug mode! This means the panel will not refresh itself. 
Go to `File > Settings` to set your truck's TFC link and to disable debug mode.
